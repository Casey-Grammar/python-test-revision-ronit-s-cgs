# Task 10 Class roll
# Write a program that takes a list of student names and sorts them
# to create a class roll. The list of names will be given on a one line
# separated by a single space.

#The student names could be entered with any combination of capitals or not.
#If they are entered with no capital first letter the list should not append.
#If they are entered with a capital first letter the list should append
#If they are entered with a mix of capitals the name should be converted to capital first letter and
#then added to the list.
